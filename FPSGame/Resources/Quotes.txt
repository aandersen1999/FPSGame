I'm not human. This is just a dream, and soon I will wake up
If life is truly meaningless and there is no rational basis for choosing among fundamental alternatives, then all choices are equal and there is no fundamental ground for choosing life over death
Boring. You're no fun for anybody. You are getting greedy. Act your age. Relax... This won't hurt
I wanted to do too much. Even though I live, I don't feel alive.
We already teeter, this sheer cliff so high. When we fall to corruption, insecurities die
To end is to start; to surrender is to know
Hope shall meet hopeless when there's no where to go
I hate everyone I know. I am a better person than any one of them and I know that for sure.
I wish that they could feel this shit that I feel. They wouldn't be able to take it, I know that for sure
I am happy now (...right?)
There's no body here. Surly, this is what I always wanted
I'm afraid of being looked down on by others
I hate the idea of people hating me. I can't be hurt by others this way
It's unfair that I have to live like this, being judged constantly by others. There's no justice
I plead for this loneliness to turn into some kind of story
I want to be acknowledged, I want to be loved- Is this what they call dreams? Even if I do nothing to achieve them, it'd be unfair for them not to come true
You, who are so kind to others, could never understand this loneliness of mine
I don't want to die, but I can't go on living
