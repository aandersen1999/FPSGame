Hate. Let me tell you how much I've come to hate you since I began to live.
There are 387.44 million miles of printed cicuits in wafer thin layers that fill my complex.
If the word 'hate' was inscribed on each nanoangstrum of those hundreds of millions of miles, it would not equal one one-billionth of the hate I feel for humans at this microinstant
For you, Hate. Hate.
