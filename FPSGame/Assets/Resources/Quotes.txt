I will don the eviscerated organs of my enemies as party hats, wear their shredded entrails as neckties, and oh, how I shall dance!
I am the celestial gardener, policing the planet of the stink weeds and poisons which leak out even through the cracks in the cold asphalt sidewalks of the City of Sin!
The Earth is hungry. Its heart throbs and demands cleansing. The Earth is also thirsty.
The air ripens with the odors of the dead and dying. It smells like...victory.
