Notes:
Needs to decide if should persue player or target with more emphisis on pursuing target.
If player gets too far, should give up pursuit
If player is within 10 feet or so, they'll start pursuing
if they are within a close distance, they will try to attack
can't have the destination change every frame. It's way too expensive on the cpu.
